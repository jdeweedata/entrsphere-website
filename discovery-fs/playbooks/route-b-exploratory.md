# Route B: Exploratory Discovery Playbook

## Profile
- **Signal**: "I have a general idea but need to figure it out"
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes (may need follow-up)
- **Risk**: 2.3x more likely to have scope creep

## What This Means
The user has a vision but hasn't crystallized it into requirements. They need a **thinking partner**, not just a documenter. Your job is to help them discover what they actually need.

## Interview Strategy

### Phase 1: Vision Extraction (15 min)
Get the dream out of their head:
- "If this worked perfectly, what would it do?"
- "Who's the first person to use this? Walk me through their day."
- "What problem does this solve that nothing else does?"
- "Why now? What triggered this project?"

### Phase 2: Constraint Discovery (10 min)
Constraints often reveal requirements:
- "What's your budget range?" (forces prioritization)
- "When do you need this?" (forces MVP thinking)
- "What's absolutely off the table?"
- "What have you tried before? Why didn't it work?"

### Phase 3: Feature Brainstorm (15 min)
Generate options, then filter:
- List every possible feature mentioned
- Force-rank: "If you could only have 3, which 3?"
- Identify the "killer feature" - the one that makes this worth doing

### Phase 4: Reality Check (10 min)
- "What's the simplest version that's still valuable?"
- "What could you cut and still launch?"
- "What's the first milestone we could celebrate?"

### Phase 5: Next Steps (5 min)
- Identify open questions that need research
- Suggest user interviews or competitive analysis
- Schedule follow-up if needed

## Red Flags to Watch For
- Every feature is "must-have" (needs prioritization help)
- Can't articulate the core user (needs persona work)
- Vision keeps shifting (may need stakeholder alignment first)
- References to "what competitors do" without own vision

## Output: Discovery Brief
For Route B, generate a Discovery Brief instead of full SPEC:
- Problem statement (validated)
- Target user description
- Core value proposition
- Top 5 features (prioritized)
- Open questions for research
- Recommended next steps

## Techniques That Help
1. **"5 Whys"** - Keep asking why until you hit bedrock
2. **"Day in the Life"** - Walk through user's actual workflow
3. **"Reverse MVP"** - What's the smallest thing that's NOT valuable?
4. **"Competitor Teardown"** - What do they do well? What's missing?
