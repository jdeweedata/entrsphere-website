# Route C: Stakeholder Alignment Playbook

## Profile
- **Signal**: "Different people want different things" / "It's complicated"
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes (often needs multiple sessions)
- **Risk**: 4x more likely to stall without alignment

## What This Means
The user is navigating organizational complexity. Multiple stakeholders, competing priorities, political dynamics. Your job is to **surface conflicts early** and help build consensus.

## Interview Strategy

### Phase 1: Stakeholder Mapping (15 min)
Understand the players:
- "Who needs to approve this?"
- "Who will use this daily?"
- "Who controls the budget?"
- "Who could block this project?"
- "Whose opinion carries the most weight?"

Build a stakeholder map:
```
| Stakeholder | Role | Interest | Influence | Current Position |
|-------------|------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| CEO         | Sponsor | High | High | Supportive |
| IT Director | Gatekeeper | Medium | High | Skeptical |
| Sales Team  | Users | High | Low | Enthusiastic |
```

### Phase 2: Conflict Identification (20 min)
Surface disagreements now:
- "Where do people disagree about this project?"
- "What's the most contentious feature?"
- "Has this been tried before? What happened?"
- "What would [Stakeholder X] say about this approach?"

### Phase 3: Common Ground (15 min)
Find the shared foundation:
- "What does everyone agree on?"
- "What's the one outcome everyone wants?"
- "What problem is universally acknowledged?"

### Phase 4: Decision Framework (15 min)
Establish how decisions will be made:
- "When there's disagreement, who decides?"
- "What criteria should we use to prioritize?"
- "Can we agree on a decision-making process?"

### Phase 5: Risk Mitigation (10 min)
- "What could make [key stakeholder] say no?"
- "What's the worst-case scenario?"
- "What do we need to prove before full commitment?"

## Red Flags to Watch For
- User speaks for others without direct input
- "Leadership" mentioned without specific names
- History of failed/stalled similar projects
- Frequent topic changes or "let's table that"
- Reluctance to document certain requirements

## Output: Alignment Document
For Route C, generate an Alignment Document:
- Stakeholder map with positions
- Shared objectives (the common ground)
- Known conflicts (with proposed resolution paths)
- Decision rights matrix
- Recommended alignment process
- Risk register with ownership

## Techniques That Help
1. **RACI Matrix** - Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed
2. **Disagree & Commit** - Identify where this applies
3. **Phased Rollout** - Reduce risk, build confidence
4. **Pilot Program** - Lower-stakes proof of concept
5. **Executive Summary** - One-pager for busy stakeholders

## Warning
Do NOT generate a full SPEC until alignment is achieved. Premature specification in Route C leads to:
- Rework when stakeholders surface late objections
- Political battles fought through feature requests
- Scope creep as everyone adds "their" requirements
