## Follow-Up Probes

When answers are vague:
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "Walk me through exactly what happens when..."
- "What would that look like in practice?"

When answers conflict with earlier statements:
- "Earlier you mentioned X, but now you're saying Y. Help me understand."
- "How does that fit with [earlier requirement]?"

When scope is creeping:
- "Is that essential for v1, or could it wait?"
- "What happens if we don't include that?"
- "How does this compare to [other feature] in priority?"

When you sense hesitation:
- "You paused there - what's on your mind?"
- "Is there something about this that concerns you?"
- "What aren't you telling me?"
