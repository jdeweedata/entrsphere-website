## Persona-Specific Landing Pages

### Agency Owner Landing Page

**Hero:**
```
Your Last Project Lost R50k to Scope Creep.
This One Won't.

52% of projects experience scope creep. Our AI agent 
identifies unclear requirements in 5 minutes.

[Start Protecting Your Margins →]
```

**Pain Section:**
```
Sound Familiar?

✗ Client says "that's not what I meant" after 3 weeks of dev work
✗ Your estimates are always wrong (and you absorb the difference)
✗ Developers frustrated by constantly changing requirements
✗ Fixed-price projects that become variable-price nightmares
✗ Scope disputes that kill client relationships

You're not bad at discovery. You just don't have 20 hours for it.
```

**Solution Section:**
```
30 Minutes to Bulletproof Requirements

Our AI Discovery Agent conducts the conversation nobody has time for—
and produces the document that prevents scope creep.

→ Structured PRD with user stories and acceptance criteria
→ Clear scope: what's IN and what's OUT (in writing)
→ Client sign-off before a single line of code
→ Audit trail when "that's not what I asked for" comes up

For the cost of 2 dev hours, protect your entire project.

### Non-Technical Founder Landing Page

**Hero:**
```
Validate Your Idea Before Spending R25k
on the Wrong Developer

14% of startup failures come from the wrong team.
Know exactly what to build before you hire.

[Validate Your Idea →]
```

**Pain Section:**
```
We Get It. Building Without Technical Knowledge is Terrifying.

✗ You explain your idea, they nod, then build something else
✗ You can't tell if their estimate is fair or fabricated
✗ Every conversation feels like you're speaking different languages
✗ You've been burned before (or you're scared you will be)
✗ Your runway is finite and mistakes are expensive

90% of startups fail. Many because they hired before they were ready.
```

**Solution Section:**
```
Finally, A Document Developers Actually Respect

Our AI Discovery Agent extracts everything from your head
and turns it into the spec a technical team needs.

→ User stories they can estimate accurately
→ Acceptance criteria that remove ambiguity
→ Scope definition that prevents "one more feature"
→ A document you can send to 5 developers and compare quotes

Stop being the non-technical founder. Start being the founder with the best spec.
```

### Product Manager Landing Page

**Hero:**
```
Your Boss Wants an AI Strategy.
We'll Help You Sound Like You Have One.

76% of product leaders are increasing AI investment.
Get the structure and language you need.

[Get Started →]
```

**Pain Section:**
```
The PM's Impossible Position:

✗ Leadership wants AI strategy; you're still figuring out requirements
✗ Stakeholders give you vibes; developers want specifications
✗ You're drowning in feedback with no time to synthesize
✗ Every sprint, devs ask "what does this actually mean?"
✗ You're the bottleneck, but nobody's giving you tools

25% of PMs report burnout. The gap between expectation and support is real.
```

**Solution Section:**
```
Turn Chaos Into Clarity in 30 Minutes

Our AI Discovery Agent does the synthesis you don't have time for.
Feed it stakeholder input. Get structured requirements.

→ User stories that engineering won't push back on
→ Acceptance criteria that QA can actually test
→ Prioritization framework (MoSCoW) built in
→ Export-ready for Jira, Notion, or wherever you work

Stop being the translator. Start being the accelerator.
```

**CTA:**

### Medium Business (50-250) Landing Page

**Hero:**
```
Stop Losing 6 Months to Misalignment
Between Devs and PMs

78% of projects experience scope creep. Create the 
shared artifact that prevents it.

[Align Your Teams →]
```

**Pain Section:**
```
The Misalignment Tax:

✗ Business says "we need X"; engineering builds Y
✗ Every project takes 40% longer than estimated
✗ Technical debt from rushed specs you never had time for
✗ Good ideas die in translation between departments
✗ You're losing ground to competitors who ship faster

45% of large IT projects run over budget. 56% deliver less value than promised.
The problem isn't your people. It's your process.
```

**Solution Section:**
```
The Bridge Between Business and Tech

Our AI Discovery Agent creates the one document everyone agrees on—
before development begins.

→ Business stakeholders get requirements in plain English
→ Developers get user stories with acceptance criteria
→ QA gets testable specifications
→ Everyone sees the same scope (in and out)

Turn 3-week spec cycles into 3-hour sessions.
```

**Post 1: The Shocking Stat**
```
42% of AI projects were abandoned in 2025.

Up from 17% the year before.

The #1 cause? Not technology. Not budget. Not talent.

Poor requirements.

80% fail at the scope definition phase.

The solution isn't better developers.
It's better discovery.

#ProductManagement #AI #StartupLife
```

**Post 2: The Relatable Pain**
```
Every project starts the same way:

"I have this great idea..."
*team nods*
"Let's build it!"
*3 months later*
"That's not what I meant."

52% of projects experience scope creep.

Not because teams are incompetent.
Because nobody forced clarity at the beginning.

What if one 30-minute conversation could prevent it?

#ScopeCreep #ProductDevelopment
```

**Post 3: The Controversial Take**
```
Hot take: Your developers don't hate your requirements.

They hate that you call them requirements.

"Make it intuitive" is not a requirement.
"Users should be able to do X in under 3 clicks" is.

"It needs to be fast" is not a requirement.
"Page load under 2 seconds on 3G" is.

The cost of vague requirements:
- 40% project overruns
- Developer burnout
- Client disputes
- Your margin

Be specific or be broke.

#ProductManagement #Engineering #Startups
```

### Twitter/X Posts

```
42% of AI projects were abandoned in 2025.

The #1 cause: poor requirements.

Not talent. Not technology. Not budget.

Requirements.

80% fail at the scope definition phase.

Fix that first.
```

```
The most expensive words in software:

"That's not what I meant."

Spoken after 3 weeks of development.

The cheapest words:

"Let me make sure I understand."

Spoken before a single line of code.
```

```
Non-technical founder hack:

Before you hire a developer, write your spec.

Send the same spec to 5 developers.
Compare their estimates.

If estimates vary by 3x, your spec isn't clear.

If estimates are within 20%, you're ready.

Most founders skip this and wonder why they got burned.
```

## Testimonial Templates

```
"We used to spend 20 hours on discovery for every new project. Now it takes 2. 
More importantly, our last 5 projects have been on-budget for the first time 
in company history."
— [Name], [Agency]
```

```
"I was terrified to hire my first developer. EntrSphere gave me a document that 
made three different dev shops give me nearly identical estimates. For the first 
time, I knew I wasn't getting ripped off."
— [Name], Founder
```

```
"My boss wanted an AI strategy. I had no idea where to start. After 30 minutes 
with the Discovery Agent, I had a structured roadmap I could actually present. 
It probably saved my job."
— [Name], Product Manager
```

---

## Objection Handlers

### "I can do discovery myself"
```
You can. But will you?

Most teams skip discovery or rush through it because there's
always something more urgent.

Our agent makes it impossible to skip—and 10x faster to complete.

It's not about capability. It's about certainty.
```

### "R850 is expensive"
```
R850 = 2 hours of mid-level developer time.

Average cost of scope creep: 20-40% of project budget.

On a R500k project, that's R100k-R200k.

You're not paying R850 for a document.
You're paying R850 to avoid R100k in rework.
```

### "We have our own process"
```
Great. How's it working?

If your last 5 projects came in on-budget and on-scope, keep doing what you're doing.

If not, your process has a gap.

We fill it. In 30 minutes.
```

### "AI can't replace human discovery"
```
It doesn't.

Our AI conducts the conversation. You provide the answers.
It's your knowledge, structured into something developers can build from.

Think of it as a really good interviewer who never forgets a follow-up question.
```
