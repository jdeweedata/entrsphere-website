## Development Consulting \& AI Integration Services

This page sells **you** (the expert) rather than just the templates. It targets businesses that have a budget but lack the expertise to set up AI-native development pipelines. The copy is positioned to be compliant (Consulting Services) but compelling (AI Integration).

***

### **Header / Hero Section**

**Headline:** Build AI-Native Products Without the Chaos.
**Sub-headline:** Expert consulting to help your team implement the EntrSphere discovery-to-deployment pipeline. Stop guessing requirements and start shipping.
**Price:** From R25,000 (~\$1,500)
**Button:** [Book a Strategy Call] (Link to Calendly/Contact Form)

***

### **The Problem (Why Hire You?)**

**"We have the tools, but not the process."**
Your team has access to Claude, GitHub Copilot, and fancy CI/CD tools. But you're still missing deadlines.

* ❌ "AI-generated code" is creating more technical debt than features.
* ❌ Stakeholders and developers are speaking different languages.
* ❌ You're spending weeks "fixing" what the AI built because the requirements were vague.

You don't need more tools. You need a **Pipeline Strategy**.

***

### **Service 1: The "Discovery Pipeline" Audit**

**For Teams Struggling with Requirements**
I will audit your current product scoping process and implement the **EntrSphere 4-Scenario Framework** directly into your workflow.

* **What You Get:**
    * Review of your last 3 PRDs/Specs (and why they failed/succeeded).
    * Customization of the "Discovery Router" for your specific business domain.
    * Training session for your Product Managers on how to use the "Non-Technical Discovery Prompt."
    * **Deliverable:** A bespoke `DISCOVERY_PLAYBOOK.md` for your team.

**Price:** R25,000 (One-time engagement)

***

### **Service 2: The "Integration Discovery" Workshop**

**For Complex/Legacy System Projects**
If you are building AI features that must talk to old databases, messy APIs, or "Spaghetti Code," this workshop saves you months of pain. We run the **Dual-Track Discovery** process (Business + Technical) to map every dependency before you code.

* **What You Get:**
    * 2-Day Virtual Workshop with stakeholders and architects.
    * Full mapping of all system touchpoints and data flows.
    * Identification of "Strategic Ambiguity" risks (political blockers).
    * **Deliverable:** A complete `INTEGRATION_SPEC.json` ready for development.

**Price:** R45,000 (Project-based)

***

### **Service 3: Custom AI Development Pipeline**

**For Teams Ready to Automate**
I will set up the technical infrastructure to let autonomous agents (like Claude Code/Ralph Wiggum) safely contribute to your codebase.

* **What You Get:**
    * **CI/CD Setup:** GitHub Actions/GitLab pipelines that run AI agents in isolation.
    * **Guardrails:** Implementation of "Retry \& Quarantine" logic for flaky tests (so AI doesn't break your build).
    * **Cost Optimization:** Setup of OAuth tokens and caching to prevent API bill shock.
    * **Deliverable:** A working "Autonomous Dev" branch in your repo.

**Price:** Custom Quote (Retainer or Fixed Bid)

### **Why EntrSphere?**

Most consultants sell "AI Hype." I sell **Process Engineering.**
I don't just "prompt" AI models. I build the rigorous frameworks (Discovery -> Spec -> Code -> Test) that allow AI models to actually deliver value in a production environment.

**My Philosophy:**
> "The prompt is not the product. The workflow is the product."

### **How to Use This**

1. **Website:** Create a page called "Consulting" or "Services."
2. **Contact:** Instead of a "Buy Now" button, use a "Book Call" or "Inquire" form. This is standard for high-ticket services.
3. **Paystack:** You can create a "Consulting Deposit" product (e.g., R5,000) if you want to take payments online, but usually, you invoice these via Paystack Invoices after the call.

This page positions you as a **Technical Partner**, which justifies the higher price point and satisfies Paystack that you are a legitimate consultancy.
