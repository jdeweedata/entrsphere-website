# give the product page for the Product Requirement Framework, Description: "Standardized templates for writing clear software specifications."

This product page focuses on the **output**—the actual documents that get built. It sells "professionalism" and "clarity" to people who worry their documentation is messy or amateurish.

***

### **Header / Hero Section**

**Headline:** Write Specs Developers Actually Love to Read.
**Sub-headline:** The standardized, fill-in-the-blank framework for creating clear, bulletproof Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and User Stories.
**Price:** R485 (~\$27)
**Button:** [Get The Framework] (Link to Paystack)

***

### **The Problem (Agitate)**

**"Where is that written down?"**
Most product documentation is a mess. It’s scattered across Slack messages, vague Notion bullets, and "mental notes."

* ❌ Developers have to guess how features should work.
* ❌ Edge cases (like error states) get forgotten until production.
* ❌ "Agile" becomes an excuse for having no plan at all.
* ❌ AI coding tools (like Claude/Cursor) fail because your prompts are unstructured.

You can't build great software on a shaky foundation.

***

### **The Solution (The Framework)**

The **EntrSphere Product Requirement Framework** is not just a "template." It is a strict standard for defining software. It forces you to answer the hard questions *before* development starts, ensuring that every feature has a clear **Happy Path**, **Sad Path**, and **Acceptance Criteria**.

It bridges the gap between "Business Talk" (what stakeholders want) and "Dev Talk" (what engineers need).

***

### **What's Inside The Toolkit**

You get the exact templates we use to manage complex builds, available in **Notion, Markdown, and PDF** formats.

**1. The "One-Pager" PRD Template**

* Perfect for fast features. Covers the Problem, Solution, and Success Metrics on a single view.
* Includes the "Anti-Goals" section (what we are NOT building) to stop scope creep instantly.

**2. The "Heavy-Duty" Technical Spec**

* For deep integrations and backend work.
* Includes sections for Database Schema, API Endpoints, and Data Flow Diagrams.

**3. The "User Story" Formula**

* Stop writing "As a user, I want..." incorrectly.
* Includes our **"Gherkin-Lite" Acceptance Criteria** guide: *Given [Context], When [Action], Then [Result].* This makes your specs testable by default.

**4. BONUS: The AI-Native `SPEC.json` Schema**

* The future of specs is machine-readable.
* Get the exact JSON structure we use to feed requirements into autonomous agents (like Ralph Wiggum/Claude Code). This turns your document into executable instructions.

***

### **Who Is This For?**

* **Junior PMs:** Look like a senior pro from Day 1.
* **Founders:** Hand off your vision to devs without being asked "what about X?" 50 times a day.
* **Consultants:** Deliver a professional artifact that justifies your fee.
* **Solo Devs:** Force yourself to think through the logic before you start coding (saves rewriting code later).

***

### **The Guarantee**

Use this framework on your next feature. If your developers don't say "This is the clearest spec I've ever seen," I'll refund your \$27 immediately.
