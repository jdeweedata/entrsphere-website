## The "Discovery Router Toolkit" Product Page

This page must sell **clarity** and **speed**. Your customer is a developer, founder, or PM who is tired of "vague requirements" killing their projects. They are afraid of wasting weeks building the wrong thing.

The copy below is engineered to pass Paystack compliance (it sells a specific "digital good") while also converting your target audience by hitting their pain points hard.

***

### **Header / Hero Section**

**Headline:** Stop Guessing Requirements. Start Building the Right Product.
**Sub-headline:** The exact framework I use to turn vague "I want an AI app" ideas into production-ready specifications in 30 minutes.
**Price:** R850 (~\$47)
**Button:** [Buy Toolkit] (Link to Paystack)

***

### **The Problem (Agitate)**

**"I'll know it when I see it."**
Every developer dreads this phrase. It means:

* ❌ Endless meetings that go in circles.
* ❌ "Scope creep" that kills your margins.
* ❌ Building a full MVP only to hear, "That's not what I meant."
* ❌ Dealing with "Strategic Ambiguity"—when stakeholders hide political blockers behind vague feature requests.

You don't have a coding problem. You have a **Discovery Problem**.

***

### **The Solution (The 4-Scenario Router)**

I built a proprietary "Discovery Router" that acts like a triage nurse for product ideas. It forces every project into one of 4 proven tracks before a single line of code is written:


| Scenario | The Signal | The Fix |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **A. Standard** | "I know exactly what I need." | Generate a rigorous PRD \& SPEC.json immediately. |
| **B. Exploratory** | "I'll know it when I see it." | Stop talking. Build a 5-min disposable prototype. |
| **C. Strategic** | "It depends / I'm not sure." | **Stop.** This is a political trap. Use the "Ambiguity Prompt" to force a decision. |
| **D. Integration** | "It needs to talk to Salesforce." | Run dual-track discovery (Business + Tech) to prevent integration hell. |

### **What's Inside The Toolkit (The Deliverables)**

This is not a "course." It is a copy-paste operating system for your product scoping.

**1. The Discovery Router Prompt (Markdown)**

* The "Master Brain" prompt that interviews your stakeholders for you.
* Automatically detects which of the 4 scenarios you are in.
* Routes the conversation to the correct follow-up questions.

**2. The 4 Specialized Sub-Prompts**

* **Non-Technical Discovery:** For stakeholders who don't speak code.
* **Exploratory Prototype:** For "vague idea" people.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** For navigating political blockers.
* **Integration Discovery:** For complex legacy system connections.

**3. The PRD \& SPEC.json Generators**

* Turn any interview transcript into a professional Product Requirements Document (PRD).
* Generate a machine-readable `SPEC.json` file that you can feed directly into AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) to start building automatically.

**4. The Moat Analysis Framework**

* A bonus guide to ensure you aren't just building a wrapper, but a defensible product with workflow integration and data loops.

***

### **Who Is This For?**

* **Freelance Developers:** Stop doing free consulting. Charge for discovery.
* **Agency Owners:** Standardize how your PMs scope projects.
* **Founders:** Validate your idea before hiring a dev team.
* **Product Managers:** Get stakeholders to commit to a direction in record time.

### **The Guarantee**

If this toolkit doesn't save you at least 10 hours of wasted meeting time on your next project, reply to your receipt email for a 100% refund. No questions asked.
